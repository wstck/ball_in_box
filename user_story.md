## user stories
A user can find the optimal value of r and mu which maximizes and sum r^2.A user can get a limited box bounded by [-1,1] with a certain number and position of samll blocks and .A user can get the exact number of balllons.A user can obtain the maximum radius(r) and the position(mu) of the ballons which do not overlap with those blocks.A user can view the sum of squares of the variable radius.
